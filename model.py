# Step 1: Data Generation (Example: Randomly generated data for demonstration)
np.random.seed(0)

# Generate synthetic data for CPU usage, memory usage, and total invocations per second
data = np.random.rand(100, 3)  # Replace this with your actual data

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Normalize the data
normalized_data = (data - data.mean(axis=0)) / data.std(axis=0)

# Split the data into training and testing sets (80% for training, 20% for testing)
train_data = normalized_data[:80]
test_data = normalized_data[80:]

# Step 3: Model Training
# Apply K-means algorithm
n_clusters = 3  # Replace with the desired number of clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=0).fit(train_data)

# Step 4: Predictive Scaling or Warming Up
# Predict cluster for new data point (current metrics)
new_data_point = normalized_data[-1]  # Replace with your actual new data point

predicted_cluster = kmeans.predict(new_data_point.reshape(1, -1))

# Based on the predicted cluster, decide whether to scale up or warm up the function
scaling_action = False
warming_up_action = False

# Define thresholds for scaling and warming up actions
scaling_threshold = 0.75  # Replace with your desired scaling threshold
warming_up_threshold = 0.5  # Replace with your desired warming up threshold

# Calculate the average metrics for each cluster
cluster_metrics = np.mean(train_data[kmeans.labels_ == predicted_cluster], axis=0)

# Compare the metrics with the thresholds to determine the actions
if cluster_metrics[0] > scaling_threshold:
    scaling_action = True

# Print the determined actions

else:
    print("No scaling action needed")

if warming_up_action:
    print("Warm up the function")
else:
    print("No warming up action needed")

# Step 5: Evaluation and Impact Measurement
# Evaluate the performance of the model using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics
train_labels = kmeans.labels_
train_predictions = kmeans.predict(train_data)

accuracy = accuracy_score(train_labels, train_predictions)
precision = precision_score(train_labels, train_predictions, average='macro')
recall = recall_score(train_labels, train_predictions, average='macro')

print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)

# Measure the impact of scaling or warming up on cold start times, resource utilization, and overall application performance
# Replace this section with your own impact measurement techniques and calculations
